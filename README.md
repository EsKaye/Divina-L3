## 🌐 GDIService: Global Divine Infrastructure API

The GDIService module provides a universal API for querying GDI token balances, user tier levels, and access gates for all games, worlds, and apps built on the Divina Layer 3 Chain.

### Endpoints
- `GET /gdi/balance/:address` — Returns the GDI token balance for a wallet address.
- `GET /gdi/tier/:address` — Returns the GDI tier (Divine, Celestial, Ascendant, Mortal) for a wallet address.
- `GET /gdi/can-access/:address/:requiredTier` — Checks if a wallet address meets or exceeds a required tier.

### Example Usage
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/gdi/balance/0xuser1
# { "address": "0xuser1", "balance": 1500 }

curl http://localhost:3000/gdi/tier/0xuser2
# { "address": "0xuser2", "tier": "Ascendant" }

curl http://localhost:3000/gdi/can-access/0xuser3/Celestial
# { "address": "0xuser3", "requiredTier": "Celestial", "canAccess": false }
```

### Integration
- **Unity/VRChat/Web**: Call these endpoints to gate features, display user tiers, or check wallet eligibility.
- **See also:** [API_REFERENCE.md](docs/API_REFERENCE.md#gdiservice-endpoints), [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)

### Architecture Update
- **Core Components Table:** Add `GDIService` as a new API module for wallet/tier/access logic.
